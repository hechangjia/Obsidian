以下是一些您应该从初学者友好的路线图开始。

There is also a [beginner DevOps roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops?r=devops-beginner) which requires you to have some backend knowledge and entails a lot of operations work i.e. deploying, scaling, monitoring, and maintaining applications.  
还有一个[初学者 DevOps 路线图](https://roadmap.sh/devops?r=devops-beginner)，它要求您具备一些后端知识，并涉及大量运营工作，即部署、扩展、监控和维护应用程序。

## Tips for Beginners   给初学者的提示

Learning to code can be overwhelming, here are some tips to help you get started:  
学习编码可能会让人不知所措，以下是一些帮助您入门的提示：

Don't get stuck in tutorial hell. It's easy to get caught up in tutorials and never actually build anything. Tutorials are great for learning, but the best way to learn is by doing. An example of this is to watch a project-based tutorial, code along with the instructor. After finishing the tutorial, try to build the same project from scratch without the tutorial (if you can't, it's okay to go back to the tutorial). Repeat this process until you can build the project without the tutorial. After that, try to add new features to the project or build something similar from scratch.  
不要陷入教程地狱。很容易陷入教程中，而从未真正构建过任何东西。教程非常适合学习，但最好的学习方式是边做边学。这方面的一个例子是观看基于项目的教程，与讲师一起编码。完成教程后，尝试在没有教程的情况下从头开始构建同一个项目（如果做不到，可以回到教程）。重复此过程，直到您可以在没有本教程的情况下构建项目。之后，尝试向项目添加新功能或从头开始构建类似的东西。

Commit to regular, consistent study sessions. It's better to study for 30 minutes every day than to cram for 10 hours once a week.  
致力于定期、持续的学习课程。每天学习 30 分钟比每周死记 10 小时要好。

Establish a clear, significant goal that motivates you. It could be building a company, an app, a website, or anything that personally resonates with you.  
建立一个明确、重要的目标来激励你。它可以是建立一家公司、一个应用程序、一个网站或任何能引起您个人共鸣的东西。

You will feel lost in the beginning. Avoid comparing yourself to others; everyone progresses at their own pace. Understand that challenges are part of the journey, and it's okay to take your time.  
一开始你会感到迷茫。避免将自己与他人进行比较;每个人都按照自己的节奏前进。要明白，挑战是旅程的一部分，慢慢来是可以的。

The best way to learn is by doing. Start building projects as soon as possible. It's okay if they're simple at first; the goal is to learn and improve. Build upon code-alongs and tutorials to create your projects and learn through hands-on experience  
最好的学习方式是边做边学。尽快开始构建项目。如果他们一开始很简单也没关系;目标是学习和改进。基于代码和教程创建项目并通过实践经验学习

Once you start learning to code, you're going to run into problems that you don't know how to solve. This is normal and part of the process. You don't really learn unless you struggle through it. That said, you won't always be able to move forward without some help. So how do you find that help? First off, forget books. They aren't a great place to start here, because the number and types of errors they can cover is so small. Online is the easiest place to find help. Most devs look for solutions on StackOverflow or just google the error message (if they have one). Other solutions are to find newsgroups or forums dedicated to the language you're using.  
一旦你开始学习编码，你就会遇到你不知道如何解决的问题。这是正常的，也是过程的一部分。除非你努力克服它，否则你不会真正学习。也就是说，如果没有一些帮助，您将并不总是能够继续前进。那么，您如何找到这种帮助呢？首先，忘掉书吧。他们不是一个好的起点，因为他们可以涵盖的错误数量和类型非常少。在线是寻求帮助的最简单场所。大多数开发人员在 StackOverflow 上寻找解决方案，或者只是在 google 上搜索错误消息（如果有的话）。其他解决方案是查找专用于您正在使用的语言的新闻组或论坛。

Join a community of learners, such as a local coding group, a Discord server, or a subreddit. It's a great way to get help, share your progress, and learn from others.  
加入学习者社区，例如本地编码组、Discord 服务器或 subreddit。这是获得帮助、分享您的进度和向他人学习的好方法。
